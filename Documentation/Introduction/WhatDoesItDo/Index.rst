What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension provides the responsive jQuery lightbox plugin Magnific
Popup for images in content elements. Opening content like videos, other websites or inline/referenced content is supported within a plugin.
Since version 0.5.0 linking images to a lightbox is supported, too.

To make the extension more flexible, some hooks are available. For example to add animations (EXT:jh_magnificpopup_animations).
