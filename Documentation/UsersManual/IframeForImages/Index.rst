Iframe for Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This describes how to open a link of an (FAL) image in a  Magnific Popup lightbox as an Iframe:

#. Add image as usually (mostly in Content Element "image" or "image and text")
#. Add link by opening the wizard
#. Scroll down the pagetree and add "mfp-link" to field "CSS-Class"
#. Save and you are done. The link opens in Magnific Popup.
